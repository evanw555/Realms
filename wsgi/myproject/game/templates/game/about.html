                He loves long walks and short shotguns. He has experience
                with both frontend and backend development, specifically
                with the Django MCV web framework, has plenty of friends
                who are cooler than your friends (and also pull), and is
                a straight up boy.

                <h3>Backend Development Intern</h3>
                <hr>
                David is a student at the University of Virginia.
                He has experience in being a goon, yet also a
                WorldStar Hip-Hop sponsored rapper and freestyler.
                He describes himself as a running "prodigy," yet
                also as a self-made man who has no one
                but himself to thank for his own success.
