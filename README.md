About Realms
============

Realms is an online multiplayer civilization-building game where users can interact with other users' kingdoms in order to establish hegemony throughout their Realm of play. Realms function as servers, and all interaction happens within a realm.

Realms is built using the Django MCV framework, using packages and libraries such as JQuery and JSGL (javaScript Graphics Library). The basis for the Django setup is another git repo made for helping developers deploy a Django 1.8 server on OpenShift.
